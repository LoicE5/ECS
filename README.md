>ECS is a simple snippets extension that allows you to easily add comments to your code with simple shortcuts. This extension currently works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScriptReact, TypeScript & TypeScriptReact. More language will be added in the future.<br><br>
>I made this extension to solve a personnal issue : how to comment web languages such as HTML, CSS and JS in the same easy and fast way. If you experiment the same issue, this extension got you covered.
