# <b>ECS (Easy Comments Snippets)</b>

><font size="2">ECS is a simple snippets extension that allows you to easily add comments to your code with simple shortcuts. This extension currently works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScriptReact, TypeScript & TypeScriptReact. More language will be added in the future.<br><br>
I made this extension to solve a personnal issue : how to comment web languages such as HTML, CSS and JS in the same easy and fast way. If you experiment the same issue, this extension got you covered. <br><br>
I aim to developp a more complete VScode extension that brings more features and a better UX Design, to make comments in every language as smooth as possible to create.</font>

In the same way, if you type <i>(or start typing)</i> <font color="seagreen"><b>/down</b></font>, then press <b>tab</b> or <b>return</b>, it will make a comment with arrows facing downwards appear.</font>
